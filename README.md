# Development plugin
Plugin for Bolt with development tools useful for creating other plugins for Bolt.

## Add from URL

## How to use
This plugin creates a snapshot of one frame by capturing all the plugin events during that frame, then renders them in a WebGL context. The full list of events can be browsed through and individually toggled using the menu, allowing any useful data to be extracted. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2kFUshOmm4) for more details.

This plugin has a very different use-case to most plugins (i.e. it's useful only to developers instead of to end users), however, it's not in any way "special". It uses the same APIs that are documented and available to any plugin.
